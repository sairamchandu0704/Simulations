Working principle of digital clock -

1 . 74LS190 - is a Synchronus Decade Counter in which 
it contains 16 pins 
	1-B	-Input	B
	2-QB	-Output	B
	3-QA	-Output	A
	4-CTBN	-Counter Enable (Input)Active Low
	5-U/D	-Up/Down Count Control (Input)
	6-QC	-Output	C
	7-QD	-Output	D
	8-GND	-Ground
	9-D	-Input	D
	10-C	-Input	C
	11-LOAD	-Parallel Load (Input)Active Low
	12-MAX/MIN -Terminal Count Output
	13-RCO	-Ripple Clock (OUTPUT)
	14-CLK	-Clock Pulse (INPUT) Active High
	15-A	-Input	A
	16-VCC	-SUPPLY
2. Ground all the inputs Except Clk&Load because we dont need them 
3. Give Clock frequency of 1khz to the clk and load to 5v
4. it will run a clock frequency to 7 segment Display so it run from 1-9
5. Now Get the Ripple Clock output And give it to clk input to another ic so
   it repples the original clock speed so it slows to 1/2 of the speed of the 
   original
6. Set a Nand gate At the output B,C of the Ic (Because we want to stop the clock at 
   60 so We need to stop the timer and restart at 60 By connecting nand gate it 
   acts like mod counter whenver we want to stop the clock we need to Set that nand gate
   A at minimum Range and B at maximum range )
7. Give the output of the nand to Load input so the Timer stops At our required range.
4. Now repeating the same method will give us sec,min,hr,Readings
